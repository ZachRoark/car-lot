# Car Lot

Create a landing page that shows available cars for sale and allow users to filter them by color. 
There are 2 URLs that will come in handy. One will give you an 

[array of all the color options](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AdamSheaffer/242f907515474ab081b5a49971bd51f4/raw/fb61fc45a3676a67f7fb5634b987a8f7393b453c/colors.json); 

the other will return an 

[array of all cars on the lot](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/AdamSheaffer/fe50daf69c713eeb1a83edc2525a4643/raw/87785ea0ac82007ae1cde7370ffb3b97054b1c41/cars.json).

Create a dropdown whose options are all the available colors. When a user chooses a color from the dropdown, the list of cars with that color should render on the screen.
